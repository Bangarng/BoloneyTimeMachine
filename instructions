To get started, you need NodeJS installed. Some modules may require you to install globally (gulp being one of them).

Once NodeJS is installed, open up command prompt and go to your project directory. From there, you can run one of several
commands.

EXAMPLES:

gulp main-dev
gulp main-public

For development purposes, you'll run only "main-dev". You can see all tasks inside the "main-dev" task and looking
up each individual task.

For production purposes, you'll need to run "main-public" and verify results. If all looks good, you'll run
"deploy-to-public" (NOT READY YET).

You can run individual tasks as needed. All are available in the tasks folder or in gulpfile.js.

========================================
To add a new comic, you'll need to go to tasks\comicsJson.js and add a new line under the last comic. From there,
you'll need to add the comic in the appropriate location under "src\strips". Once completed, you can run "main-dev" to verify.

If you only want to rebuild files, you can manually run "gulp build-comics-json" && "gulp build-pages-comic-list".

Once a new comic is added, it is a good idea to verify that it worked.
========================================
To modify templates, you can go to "src\templates" and modify the files there. Each file is separated appropriately,
such as header, footer, meta, and body. Body files are under body.
